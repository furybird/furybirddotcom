				<h6>Immersive 6-week Design Consulting Program & User-Validated Rapid Prototype </h6>
				<p>I lead a team of 3 designers who worked with 2 business consultants and a client team of 10 key personnel from a leading European bank hand-in-hand for 6 weeks to re-imagine their small to medium enterprise lending process. Over 6 weeks, the teams worked closely to re-imagine the lending experience from the customer’s perspective. We focused on investigating how to transform the current, rigid in-person experience to a digital omni-channel experience. The design team itself worked with existing customers and key areas of the business to rapidly envision a significantly improved customer journey that resonated with customers and catalyzed business transformation through introducing new operationally efficient processes.</p>

					<h3>Highlights of what I did:</h3>
					<p>I planned and facilitated a 2 day workshop with a 30 person stakeholder team that included representation from corporate VPs, bank business relationship managers, operations, compliance, legal & technology to to align on the objective and strategy.</p>

					<p>Validating a level of desirability of new ideas with existing consumers in order to maximize adoption and reduce risk was one of the approaches our client bought into, so I designed and executed a plan for how to gather, analyze and incorporate on-going user feedback to the 6 week process.</p>

					<p>The company did not have digital branding guidelines that proved successful in connecting with their customers, so I directed one of our team designers to evolve their current guidelines to a direction that was more modern and better receptive to their current audience’s tastes.</p>

					<p>We left the team with a robust prototype and a set of tools to guide decision-making going forward. I played a large hand in advising the team on next steps beyond the program since the concept was immedately funded for development. These next steps involved a strategy for breaking down the concept into buildable pieces, how to validate & measure impact upon release.</p>

					<h4>Challenges</h4>
					<p>• Our research indicated that there was little existing knowledge of the process for SME lending on the customer’s side and that when businesses realized they needed money, the process was an unplanned, daunting and stressful one.</p>

					<p>• The existing process revealed to be one centered around the bank’s needs and terminology, rather than the customer’s. This made for a situation where paperwork often was not completed by customers and loan opportunities were lost.</p>

					<p>• The underwriting processes had not been revisited for the digital realm. The existing reliance the bank had upon wet signatures for final approval was a difficult challenge to take on, and ultimately came down to clearly weighing out the risks versus the gains.</p>

				<div id="right-col" class="five columns">
					<object id="resolution" type="image/svg+xml" data="assets/resolutionicon_71x86.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object>
					<h4>Impact</h4>
					<p>• As part of the customer experience reinvention, we produced customer personas and design principles to use as key tools for guiding rapid decision-making in desgining a significantly improved customer journey.</p>

					<p>• The result was a clickable prototype of the ‘happy path’ that we iterated and tested the design with 11 customers and ~30 colleagues.</p>

					<p>• By week 6, we were able to present an omni-channel consistent experience, evolving the current lengthy process of 5-20 days to cash-in-hand experience to that of one that can take less than 10 min in some cases.</p>

					<p>• We also completed 6 business design deep-dives to streamline the bank’s internal processes as well. The end result was a new set of business processes that reduced to 20+ steps to 6 concrete steps. This was immediately approved for funding and development upon delivery.</p>

					<h4>Multi-disciplinary Perspective</h4>
					<p>During the inital 2 day workshop, the client was exposed to benefits of a design driven approach most relevant to them. At the same time, they were able to catch us up to speed on their existing challenges.</p>
					<h4>A Shift in Language</h4>
					<p>The first phase post-workshop was to perform a deep analysis of the bank’s existing lending & operational processes. Our initial evaluation revealed a process plagued by difficult to repeat or understand expert terminology & processes. One of our primary redesign principles was to reshape the experience through customer’s eyes. </p>

					<h4>Incorporating Education as a Key Part of the Customer Experience</h4>
