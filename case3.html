				<h6>Mobile Integrated Healthcare On-demand Service and AI Triage Chatbot</h6>
				<p>I worked as the VP of Product at Pager, an early stage healthcare on-demand startup. The company was focused on reducing healthcare costs by routing patients to the most cost effective level of care through a mobile application and a robust set of clinical operational processes. At Pager, I curated a process to support measured and considered results, team-development, driving & defining the vision of our platform, as well as packaging our value proposition in a digestible way to support sales. I was product employee #1, and this was a job with many hats. I found myself wherever there is a gap in need – from foundational user research, system, service, interaction and front end designer, to process evangelist to cultural advocate. I also worked closely with our Operations and Engineering teams to create delightful experiences for Pager’s customer facing and internal applications used by our Doctor group.</p>

					<h3>Highlights of what I did:</h3>
					<p>When I came into Pager, there was very little knowledge about their existing customer base or who they wanted to target. I directed my team to define our audience’s needs and assess how the company might better serve people seeking care. The company was able to utilize these insights and created peace of mind to know we were focusing our resources towards areas that had the most promise for impact.</p>

					<p>I directed the product team to apply the foundational audience findings and we were able to revise the customer-facing platform significantly. We worked with the engineering team on an alpha release of these revisions that also incorporated AI chat technology.</p>

					<p>I performed an asssessment of the company’s exsting product process, which was convoluted, not repeatable, and not getting the company to desired results. I worked with leadership, operations, marketing, and engineering to implement a new product process that supported needs-driven decision-making, objectives as well as measuring outcomes.</p>

					<p>With my Director of UX, we formulated a hiring process to suit our vetting criteria and built a team to support our rolling design and product needs.</p>

					<h4>Challenges</h4>
					<p>• Expanding the perception of design internally beyond beautification was a major challenge.</p>

					<p>• The healthcare industry is used to a very inside-out way of thinking – often fixated on their own internal processed. A shift in thinking to focus on user needs is still foreign to many in healthcare. Stakeholders can be quick to assume they know what’s best based on industry norms, without understanding the user needs that will drive growth.</p>

					<p>• A business model focused on short-term cost savings for the payor leaves little incentive to do more than replicate the existing care experience.</p>

					<p>•My team made many attempts to incorporate service improvements and evolve the product for enterprise, and not all the stakeholders were on board.</p>

					<h4>Impact</h4>
					<p>• My team’s new sales materials secured new contracts covering 500k+ people as a result of efforts to redesign the way the platform was sold to enterprise partners.</p>

					<p>• The product team worked across teams to revise the customer acquisition process for an effected annual savings of $1M by identifying unsuccessful customer acquisition moments with the development of a product acquisition funnel tool.</p>

					<p>• The product team drove an initative to reposition the brand to gain patient trust and drive adoption. We assembled product messaging from consumer ideals to communicate value in their language. This was in production as I departed ways from Pager, but is currently live now.</p>

					<p>• Designed the initial incorporation of artificial intelligence technology into the healthseeking process. This has just been released Spring 2017.</p>

					<h4>Falling Short in Developing Relationships with Patients</h4>
					<p>Steady active users and repeat engagement were both on-going challenges when I joined. The company was operating on a lot of assuptions. Our research efforts showed us that people are looking to develop an on-going relationship with medical providers.  As a result, services such as Pager for unplanned care came off as high-risk and low reward.</p>
					<h4>The Cost of Healthcare has Turned People into More Careful Consumers</h4>
					<p>We uncovered a belief that urgent care lacks long-term value and introduces the risk of unpredictable costs. Our research respondents were convinced they could predict how long an illness would last, and based on this, determined how much it was worth. All were nervous about unanticipated healthcare expenses and reluctant to spend money on care that did not contribute to his long-term health.</p>

This change led to a calculation of $1M annual savings. </p>

				<h4>Advocating for an Ideal Experience</h4>
				<p>Service design techniques like journey mapping, workflow diagrams, and service blueprinting were used to tie research findings and new concepts into the larger customer experience across multiple touchpoints. These visual tools also framed constructive conversations around operational changes. The operational teams in particular found it very helpful to be provided updated workflow diagrams for internal training and documentation purposes.</p>

					<h4>Revamping Patient Onboarding for Better Results Over Time</h4>
					<p>In an unplanned care moment, our nurses used text protocols adapted from call center triage guidelines including Briggs and Thompson-Schmidt. The protocols begin by identifying chief complaint and then reviewing signs and symptoms indicative of high-level of acuity. This process via text message quickly proved cumbersome for patients – especially someone feeling ill. Alongside the Operations team, my team worked to identify key moments where the clinician and patient experiences would benefit from automation (and where it might improve key KPIs). We developed a series of widgets that were intended for things like booking urgent care, scheduling a referral, and reminders for appointments and medication.</p>

					<h4>A Conversation-based Experience</h4>
					<p>We found in our research that patients value provider relationships because they think it leads to better care and greater understanding of their issues. We used this as a insight to ideate ways to encourage relationship-building in the experience. Combined with the fact that the company had made a decision to invest in chat technology, our response was to evolve the experience to be conversation-centered.</p>

				<h3>Tying it all together</h3>
				<p>Mobile health on-demand services are still facing an uphill batttle as they compete for consumers against more tried and true methods such as 911, emergency rooms and brick and mortar urgent care centers. The stakes are high, and consumers are careful to try anything new during a highly emotional event. Partnering with health systems and creating low risk connections with patients in advance shows promise, but it is certainly a long road ahead before we see vast improvement in the consumer health experience any time soon.</p>
